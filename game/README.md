# Metro Station Designer — the game

The playable vertical slice (V0–V5) of draft 1 of [`../PLAN.md`](../PLAN.md) — a URL where you dig
a box into the ground and watch three thousand people break it. That plan is now superseded: the
current plan grows this slice into the **base game** (B1–B6, single line), and this README tracks
the milestones as they land.

It is its own application. Its own `package.json`, Vite config, tests and Cloudflare
Worker (`metro-game`). It imports nothing from `web/` or `art/`.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
npm run build      # tsc --noEmit && vite build -> dist/
npm run test       # node --test: determinism, tick budgets, capacity ladder
npm run bench      # the crowd-tick micro-benchmark from PLAN §2.1
```

## Where things live

```
src/
  sim/       PURE TypeScript. No DOM, no worker, no three. Runs in Node.
    constants.ts     every tuning number, including the time base
    stock.ts         A/B/C car classification
    finishes.ts      surface finishes: the family decides behaviour, §4.3
    zones.ts         fare zones: the boundary is a barrier, §4.5
    worker.ts        the only file that touches postMessage
  render/    three.js: chunk mesher, procedural materials, module models, outline, shadows, agents
  build/     station document, cell commands, paint, undo
  persistence/ save schema (serialise / parse / migrate *.metro.json)
  app/       React shell: HUD, rails, inspector. Panels only, no sim logic
  data/      the reference station and the art palette
test/        node --test suite (imports src/sim/*.ts directly)
bench/       crowd-tick benchmark
```

Dependency direction is one-way: `app/ → render/ → sim/`, and `sim/` imports nothing.

## The milestones

Draft 1's vertical slice is **done** (V0–V5). The base game plan picks it up at B1.

| | Contents | Acceptance | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| V0 | Shell: dark canvas, orbit camera, grid, FPS/tick readout | — | done |
| V1 | Rounded-corner mesher + material lab at `/lab` | reads as a designed building; chunk build < 4 ms | done |
| V2 | Build loop: 2×2 seed, extrude/dig, work plane, level slicing, undo | the spec's M0 test | done |
| V3 | Crowd: worker at 5 Hz, station graph, agents, LOS overlay | 3,000+ agents, p99 tick < 8 ms, determinism asserted in Node | done |
| V4 | Train, per-door queues, boarding, left-behind, the fix | an under-built station breaks and the fix works | done |
| V5 | Own Worker project, deployed | the deploy section below | done |
| **B1** | Cell faces, finish catalogue, per-face materials, paint tools, tactile strips, static save v1 | distinct materials, a floor finish that changes path cost, save round-trip | **done** |
| **B2** | Fare zones, the zone boundary as a movement barrier, zone paint + overlay | an ungated fare line strands the crowd; a gate restores flow | **core done** |
| B3–B6 | Capacity kit, draw kit, authored time + charts + snapshot, ship | see [`../PLAN.md`](../PLAN.md) §4 | planned |

**B1** shipped `sim/finishes.ts` (the finish table), faces in `sim/types.ts`, one chunk-mesh part per
finish, the walk-speed rule, the `N`/`M`/`I` paint tools, the tactile-strip decal layer along
platform edges, and `persistence/save.ts` (`formatVersion: 1`, static). The mesher's cell-key
packing was also fixed — the old bit-shift `key()` collided neighbouring cells, which would have
made finish lookups wrong.

**B2's core** shipped `sim/zones.ts`, `Cell.zone`, a graph rule that emits no walk edge across a
zone line except through a gate cell, a zone bucket paint tool, the `分区热力` overlay, and an
inspector zone control. Still open in B2: zone inference (a room enclosed by gates proposed `paid`),
module zone-legality feedback for ticket machines, and the gate direction/anchor UI.

**The module art pass** (part of PLAN §3 item 6, ahead of B3/B4) replaced the unit-cube modules with
`render/models.ts`: procedural ticket machines, turnstile cabinets, escalators, exits and platform
screen doors, plus rolling stock. PSDs are drawn from the `platform-edge` run (the screen the graph
already models as doors); trains are posed by `World.trainRenderState()`, sent through the worker
protocol, and drawn per consist by `SceneRenderer.setTrains`. The models are pure three.js geometry
over one shared material kit — no image or GLB assets. Modules are level-aware, so a tall escalator
or exit ghosts with the floor it belongs to instead of drawing through it.

**Ramps carve their way in.** `sim/openings.ts` (`carveRampOpenings`) removes the solid cells an
escalator, stair or lift climbs through, so a placed ramp surfaces from an opening rather than
through the slab; the landing cells are protected because the graph uses them as the ramp's nodes.
`data/reference-station.ts` runs the same carve, so the demo no longer shows escalators punching
through the concourse floor. An escalator is single-direction and carries **one passenger per step**
at 0.5 m/s over a 0.4 m pitch — 75/min, and exactly one rider per step on the run.

**Every demo exit is a head-house over an up + down pair.** Each of the three surface exits owns a
down run and an up run two metres apart, landing on the exit's own row; `models.ts` draws the exit
as a steel-and-glass canopy whose roof reaches over that pair, so the escalators surface from a hole
in the plaza under cover — the reference photo. `exitYaw` faces the mouth at the *midpoint* of the
nearest run, so a down bay on one side and an up bay on the other still reads as one entrance.

**The head-house is solid, and the opening is the way.** `sim/exits.ts` holds the geometry the sim
and the renderer share. The exit's graph node is the street opening (the doorway cell, not the cell
under the canopy), and the glass sides and back wall are barriers in the walk graph, so the crowd
walks in and out through the opening and never through a wall. A bare portal opts out with
`cfg.headHouse: false` (the small test stations do).

**No ramps stacked.** A ramp also has a collision envelope (`rampEnvelope` / `rampBlocked`): a
bounding box around the run, the truss and the balustrade. Up and down runs must sit in separate
columns (the demo's banks are two metres apart), and `setUpEscalators` refuses a column an existing
ramp already occupies, so a second escalator can never be dropped immediately below a first.

`test/` holds the acceptance tests. Run them with `npm test`:

* `determinism.test.mjs` — same seed + tick ⇒ byte-identical positions, and no unseeded
  randomness anywhere in `sim/`.
* `budget.test.mjs` — a 3,000+ agent station steps with a p99 worker tick inside the
  spec's 8 ms comfort target.
* `pathcache.test.mjs` — a synchronised 520-agent re-path wave rides the `(from, to,
  needsClass)` cache, and the per-tick A* budget is never exceeded.
* `capacity.test.mjs` — the §7.8 capacity ladder as a comparison: one platform escalator
  jams, three fix it; a saturated platform leaves people behind.
* `layering.test.mjs` — `sim/` imports nothing and touches no DOM; `render/` never reaches
  up into `app/`; `build/` imports neither.
* `surfaces.test.mjs` — a slow floor finish is a real detour, a track bed is not a walkable
  node, paint/fill/erase are immutable, and the mesher groups by finish (B1).
* `save.test.mjs` — the `metro-save` v1 envelope round-trips the static station and names
  every failure mode (B1).
* `zones.test.mjs` — an ungated fare line strands the crowd (zero boardings); a gate restores
  flow; the graph has no edge across the line; the zone bucket respects a drawn boundary (B2).
* `trains.test.mjs` — a dispatched train gets a pose on the track beside its platform edge,
  a stop is a fixed berth/open/dwell/close/hold/depart sequence, and the pose is deterministic
  (the rolling-stock render path).

## The simulation's time base

GAME-SPEC §10.3 asks for 24 simulated hours in ~12 real minutes *and* a 5 Hz continuous
crowd. Those two cannot both hold: 12 min/day is 24 simulated seconds per 200 ms tick,
and 24 s of walking is 32 m — a crowd that teleports 32 m per tick cannot be separated,
queued or watched. PLAN §2.1's own benchmark steps agents at the 0.2 s tick.

This build keeps the crowd honest and runs the clock fast instead:

* **one simulated second per tick**,
* **1× is real time**: one tick per real second, so the crowd walks at true speed, the
  AM peak is ~90 real minutes, and a train every 150 s of sim time is every 150 real
  seconds,
* **fast-forward multiplies ticks per second, never the step size**, so §7.6 determinism
  is untouched.

`SIM_SECONDS_PER_TICK` in `src/sim/constants.ts` is the one number to change, and the
comment there explains the trade.

## Deliberate divergences from PLAN / GAME-SPEC

* **No react-three-fiber.** The scene is a plain three.js `SceneRenderer` driven by a
  React `Viewport` component. The renderer we judge at `/lab` is the renderer the game
  keeps either way; R3F would have added a reconciler between us and the chunk mesher.
* **Inner fillets are dropped.** PLAN R2's named fallback: the mesher rounds convex
  outer corners and chamfers exposed top edges by 12.5 cm, but does not fillet concave
  inner corners.
* **The day clock is real time at 1×, not 120×** (above).
* **Zones, surfaces, save/load, settings, charts and the module catalogue beyond
  escalator / gate / TVM / bench / exit are out of scope**, exactly as PLAN §7 lists.
* **One line.** Transfers therefore resolve to an exit; §7.5 is not exercised.

## Measured

On this machine (Node 24, desktop):

| Measure | Value | Budget |
|---|---|---|
| Crowd, p99 worker tick | 2.2 ms at 3,257 agents | < 8 ms comfort, 200 ms hard |
| Crowd, mean worker tick | 0.9 ms | — |
| Chunk mesh build, before B1 | ~3.7 ms warm, ~5 ms on the very first chunk (JIT) | < 4 ms |
| Chunk mesh build, per-face finishes (B1) | **1.9 ms** for a one-layer station floor chunk, 2.7 ms for two, 4.4 ms for a fully solid 8-layer block | < 4 ms |
| Frame | 60 fps in a windowed GPU; the headless software rasteriser used for
  CI screenshots is the limit there, not the scene | 16.6 ms |

B1's per-face materials make the mesher sort faces into one part per finish. A real station
chunk is a thin floor slab and stays well inside the budget (1.9 ms); the figure that misses
is a *fully solid* 16×16×8 block, which is geometry-bound rather than finish-bound and was
near the line before B1 too. PLAN R2's fallback if that ever gets worse is to drop the rounded
vertical corners and keep the top bevels only.

## Deploy

```bash
npm run build
npx wrangler deploy -c wrangler.jsonc
```

From the repository root, `npm run deploy:game` does both steps and also attaches the routes.

`wrangler.jsonc` serves the game from the path prefix `https://ericpzh.rest/metro-game/` via
[`worker/index.js`](worker/index.js), so the website's 游戏 tab can embed it same-origin. The two
routes `ericpzh.rest/metro-game` and `ericpzh.rest/metro-game/*` are declared under `routes` in the
same file, so `wrangler deploy` creates them — there is no dashboard step. Two routes, not one: the
bare path needs its own. The Worker's own `workers.dev` root keeps working at the same time.

Two notes:

* `wrangler` warns that the routes "will attempt to serve Assets on a configured path" (it looks for
  `dist/metro-game/*`). Nothing lives there, so those requests fall through to the Worker, which
  strips the prefix and reads from the asset root. The warning is cosmetic.
* The site's Workers Builds project deploys `metro` only; nothing on push deploys this Worker. Either
  run `npm run deploy:game` yourself or add a second Workers Builds project as the root README
  describes.

To host it at the `workers.dev` root only, delete `main`, the `assets.binding`, the `routes` and the
`ASSET_PREFIX` var, and set `assets.not_found_handling` back to `"single-page-application"`. The
build needs no change either way.

If the site's tab should point somewhere else — a preview URL, a different domain — set
`VITE_GAME_URL` when building `web/`.
