# Model library

The third app beside `web/` and `game/`: a standalone Vite + three.js character
viewer. Choose the approved male commuter or female variants, inspect front/side/
back/oblique views, stand or walk at three profiles, and download the selected GLB.
The viewer has English and Chinese labels. Long hair is available only without a
backpack; adding a backpack selects shoulder-length hair. Male characters have
original, short and bald styles, each with or without a backpack. Short and bald
share the same close-fitting scalp geometry with hair and skin colors respectively.

From the repository root:

```powershell
npm run setup:model
npm run dev:model     # http://127.0.0.1:5175/
npm run build:model   # standalone model/dist
npm run preview:model # http://127.0.0.1:4175/
npm start             # web 5173 + game 5174 + model 5175
```

`npm start` reuses listening services and starts the others. Ctrl+C stops only the
services that launcher started. Each app can still be started independently.

`src/characters/female.js` owns the character variant builder. The older prototype
re-exports it for compatibility. `src/animation/` owns the accepted foot-targeted
gait; existing root tooling re-exports it. `src/characters/shoulders.js` folds the shared collar tabs into a smooth
neck-to-shoulder profile for every library model. It also rounds the shared jaw
and rear neck and folds chest protrusions into a fitted front surface.
`src/characters/front-boundaries.js` splits that surface at the neckline, shirt
and strap boundaries so overlapping source layers keep the same flat color.
Crown widths now match the slim long
hair while retaining the cleaned hip silhouette and backpack rules.

`scripts/prepare-assets.mjs` runs before dev/build. It regenerates the female
exports and copies them into ignored `public/models/`. It adds the approved male
geometry with the same slow/medium/fast clips, generated from the game's walk
profiles, plus five male variants. Bagless variants remove straps and close the
jacket back; cropped variants replace the hair with a smooth head-skinned scalp.
`provenance.json` records the original male source hash and generation
inputs. The source assets remain in `prototypes/`; generated GLBs do not need to
be committed twice. Node 24+ is needed by the preparation scripts.

Production is self-contained: `model/dist` includes all eleven GLBs, reference art,
profiles, and bundled viewer code. It does not request game dependencies or
prototype paths at runtime. Set `VITE_WEB_URL` and `VITE_GAME_URL` when building
to change the two navigation links. No cloud deployment is configured by this change.

The game uses the same eleven exports with equal 1/11 selection chances. Run
`npm run bake:passengers` at the root after approving a model change; it regenerates
the GLBs and shared game atlas. `src/characters/library.js` is the canonical
catalogue for the viewer and game bake. Use `.agents/skills/metro-model/SKILL.md`
for the dedicated model workflow.

To refresh the art after approving models, run **`npm run art:models`** at the root.
It regenerates the reviewed exports and game atlas, builds the game, captures
every catalogue entry in standing and complete walks, refreshes the interface
captures for sheet 07 in both languages, updates sheets
01/02/07/12/13 in Chinese and English, checks animation, renders previews into
`.preview/sheets/`, and builds/syncs the site. No deployment is performed.

For an art-only refresh of the current game atlas use
`npm run art:models -- --from-game`; it still builds the game before capturing.
New models are added to `src/characters/library.js` and the export
builder/preparation script; update the explicit game library test to pin the new
catalogue. Capture pools and bounded batches grow automatically;
the capture manifest records the atlas and model hashes, and stale game exports
or incomplete walk cycles fail before sheet generation.

The model-art command uses dedicated `.preview/model-art/` captures and free
browser ports, so it can coexist with other local previews.
